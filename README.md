# Bham-Group-Project


This repo contains work completed as part of a group project for the University of Birmingham Computer Science Msc.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the project was cancelled before completion and was never assessed.

Despite this, the program is complete and works as expected. A database will need to be configured prior to use.

Our program is an online pictionary-esque game where multiple players can connect to the server and play the game in multiple different game rooms.
