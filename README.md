# Bham-Group-Project


This repo contains work completed as part of a group project for the University of Birmingham Computer Science Msc.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the project was cancelled before completion and was never assessed.

Despite this, the program is effectively complete minus all the JavaDoc and JUnit tesing and runs as expected.

Our program is an online pictionary-esque game where multiple players can connect to the server and play the game in multiple different game rooms.
